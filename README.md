# Key Features
Tensor Computation: Similar to NumPy, but with strong GPU acceleration.
Dynamic Computational Graphs: Allows for more intuitive model building and debugging.
Autograd: A tape-based automatic differentiation library that supports all differentiable Tensor operations.
TorchScript: A way to create serializable and optimizable models from PyTorch code.
Extensive Libraries: Includes libraries for neural networks, optimization, and more.
# Why PyTorch?
Pythonic: PyTorch integrates seamlessly with Python, making it easy to use and extend.
Dynamic Graphs: Unlike static computational graphs, PyTorch’s dynamic graphs allow for more flexibility and ease of debugging.
Community and Ecosystem: A large and active community contributes to a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries.
# Getting Started
To get started with PyTorch, you can install it via pip:
```
pip install torch
```
Here’s a simple example to get you started:

```
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Perform a simple operation
y = x + 2

print(y)
```
